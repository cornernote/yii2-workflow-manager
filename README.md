$ composer require victorsemenow/yii2-workflow-manager "*"
```

```
"victorsemenow/yii2-workflow-manager": "*"
```

to the `require` section of your `composer.json` file.


## Migrations

```
$ php yii migrate --migrationPath=@victorsemenow/workflow/manager/migrations
```


## Configuration

```php
$config = [
    'components' => [
        'workflowSource' => [
            'class' => 'victorsemenow\workflow\manager\components\WorkflowDbSource',
        ],
    ],
    'modules' => [
        'workflow' => [
            'class' => 'victorsemenow\workflow\manager\Module',

## Usage

Simply visit `?r=workflow` within your application to start managing workflows.

Once you have defined a workflow, you can attach it to a model as follows:

```php
class Post extends \yii\db\ActiveRecord
{
    public function behaviors()
    {
        return [
            [
                'class' => \raoul2000\workflow\base\SimpleWorkflowBehavior::className(),
                'defaultWorkflowId' => 'post',
                'propagateErrorsToModel' => true,
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```
